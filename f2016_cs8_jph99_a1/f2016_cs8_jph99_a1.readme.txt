The program asks the user to enter either + or -, depending on the system that they want to use.
If the user enters anything other than + or -, the program displays "Error" and then ends.
Once the user enter either + or  -, the program asks the user to enter how far they drove and how muc hgas they used,
and converts based on the system. If the user has entered +, the variables assigned will be the USC gas and distance, and
then the Metric gas and distance will be found, and the same thing the other way.
Once the data entered is collected and converted, the miles per gallon and liters per 100 Km are calculated.
Finally, once everything has been calculated, the program displays the data in a table.
