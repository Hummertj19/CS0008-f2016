Since we were required to use a class for this project, unlike the last one, I decided to just start over, but use the same
logic that I used in the third assignment. The first thing I did was define the runners class, and define all of the methods
that we were required to. Then, I defined a function that would go through the master file, open each file in the master file,
skip the newline, and then take all of the data and put it into an empty list that I called the 'result_list'. The next step
was to split each line at it's comma and take away the newline character, which I did in the function in one line. Then I
appended the name and distance to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list. Next I had to ask the user
to enter the master file, asking for the full path just incase. Then I created a new empty list, called 'raw_data', and I
looped through all of the files and added them to this list. Here I used the method Max used in his solution he shared with us.
Next, I calculated the total number of lines read and the total distance ran by everybody by taking the length of the raw data
list and then adding all of the distances up. My next step was initialize the min and max distance variables, since I knew I
had to find them and this seemed like an easier way than how I did it in Assignment 3. Then I looped through the runners list
and for min and max did the same thing: if it found a value either higher or lower than what it had at the current moment, it
would reassign the higher or lower value to the max/min distance, and once it had looped through all the lines, it would have
both the highest and lowest value of distance ran, plus the person who did it. Then I found the total number of participants
by taking the length of the runners list, because this combined each person if they appeared more than once. Then I got the
# of participants who appeared more than once by counting them if they had a value of over 1 for appearing multiple times for
the getRuns method. After that, I used the print function to display all of the data I calculated. Finally, I created an output
file the contained the results of the program, and closed the file at the end.
